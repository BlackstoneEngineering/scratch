# Tutorials
Below are tutorials to help you understand mbed TLS. The tutorials consist of three sections grouped by time to completion. Intro tutorials take <5 min, intermediate tutorials take 5-10 min and advanced tutorials take 10+ min. Make sure to complete the [Getting started with mbed TLS]() guide to familiarize yourself with the ecosystem. 

## Intro (<5 min)
- [Benchmark example](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/mbed-os-examples/code/mbed-os-example-tls-benchmark/) - Benchmark various cryptographic primitives mbed TLS offers.

## Intermediate (5-10 min)
- [Benchmark example with authentication](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/mbed-os-examples/code/mbed-os-example-tls-authcrypt/) - Use authenticated encryption and authenticated decryption of a buffer.
- [HTTPS file download example](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/mbed-os-examples/code/mbed-os-example-tls-tls-client/) - Download a file from an HTTPS server, and look for a specific string in that file.

## Advanced (10+ min)
- [SHA-256 hash example](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/mbed-os-examples/code/mbed-os-example-tls-hashing/) - Perform hashing of a buffer with SHA-256 using various APIs.
- [mbed TLS porting guide](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-handbook/en/latest/advanced/tls_porting/) - Port mbed TLS to a new mbed development board.
- [mbed TLS hardware acceleration](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-handbook/en/latest/advanced/tls_hardware_acceleration/) - Add hardware acceleration support to a development board in mbed OS and integrate it with mbed TLS. [Note: Duplicated in mbed OS.]
